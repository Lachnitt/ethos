ethos 0.1.1 prerelease
======================

- The options `--no-normalize-dec`, `--no-normalize-hex`, `--binder-fresh`, and `--no-parse-let` now only apply when reference parsing. In other words, when parsing Eunoia signatures and proofs, decimals and hexidecimals are never normalized, variables are always unique for their name and type, and let is never treated as a builtin way of specifying macros.
- Adds a new option `--normalize-num`, which also only applies when reference parsing. This option treats numerals as rationals, which can be used when parsing SMT-LIB inputs in logics where numerals are shorthand for rationals.

ethos 0.1.0
===========

This is the initial release of the Ethos proof checker.  Ethos implements the Eunoia logical framework which is a logical framework targeted at SMT solvers.  It allows users to define proof formats and write proofs.

This release of Ethos is associated with the 1.2.0 release of the SMT solver cvc5.  It can check the proofs generated by cvc5's native proof format `cpc`.  Ethos and Eunoia have reached a certain level of stability, but they are still under active development.
