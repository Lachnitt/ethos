TODO:

- :syntax
- remove closure parsing? maybe alf.lambda is useful for a native alf.map
- check type preservation for evaluation?
  - more generally: a weaker type system for program bodies?
- minimize compiled code by recognizing alpha-equivalent patterns
    - parameters can be shared??
- lazy construction of definitions when compiled?
  - compiled fine grain inclusion??
- non-exponential alf.ite compilation
- warn unused parameters
- don't always use mkExprInternal in evaluate (@lazyHash)
- fix printing decimals
- define-fun-rec parsing
- non-macro define-fun? assume-define?
- set-option


CVC5-TODO:

- define-fun-rec
- fine grained inclusion of signatures to avoid overloading
- set.insert
- ambiguous datatype constructors

- rewrite as a ALF proof rule
- minimize rewrite proofs? A = A' ^ B = true => (or A B) = true -----> B = true => (or A B) = true
- substitute as an ALF proof rule
- convert as an ALF proof rule


COMPLETED:

- datatypes
- literal ops to compiler
- auto-evaluate literal ops
- change syntax for nil, for eval.
- :restrict
- bitvectors
- datatype testers
- howto: bitvector literal type rule
- strings
- alf.ite smart evaluation, not just literals
- alf.is_eq not just literals
- change @ to _
- :requires for implicit is dropped, maybe simplify
- failures in side conditions?
- generalize CLI
- show compiled files via --show-config
- proper compilation of alf.ite / alf.is_eq
- alf.cons for list variables at non-tail locations
- ensure assumption scope level is preserved per include file
- X remove custom nil construction policy?
- separate symbol table for proof rules?
- type field separate from Expr? (to save memory)
- Temporary memory allocation of Expr within calls to evaluation?
- memory safe
- Literal inherits from ExprValue
- n-ary literal ops
- arity overloading?

- sorts introduced internally to proof (fmf-fun)
- INDEXED_ROOT_PREDICATE
